# advanced-search
Chrome extension providing more advanced 'find on page' functionality.

Searches are performed as you type, and there are regex options to further filter results. These are currently 'match case' and 'whole words'. I intend to allow more customizable regexes in future versions.

CTRL + ðŸ † to go to next match; CTRL + ðŸ „ to go to previous.

#####Known Issues:
* Regex choice is limited to two options and not customizable.
* Search results are wiped if popup loses focus - maybe ought to be more like Chrome inbuilt finder and persist them so user can click off and scroll freely.
* Marking locations of results in the scrollbar like Chrome inbuilt finder would be helpful in this regard.
